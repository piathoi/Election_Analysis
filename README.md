  ## Election Audit Summary
  
  Not only can this script help us find the most number of votes for candidates and county, it can help us find different characteristics if the data has information like demographics and geography. This script can also be modified to determine patterns among the characteristics. For example, we could test the percentage of voters by county against each candidate so we can determine which candidate was the most popular within a county or geogrphical area.
